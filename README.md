# Fragen an einen Knappen (Questions to a Squire)

This is a collection of teaching question to be posed to a squire for training to be a knight.

This is the bases for a book to be used as a prop in a LARP (Live Action Roleplaying) game. It has no historical relevance and is only very loosely based on the concept of chivalry of the European middle ages (approx. 13th to 15th century).

This is part of an attempt to recreate a feel for the social position and self image of knights in the above time period, after eliminating all the decoration the victorian age attached to it and has since been reproduced continuously in movie and book.

the Time period is rather long for a typical living history/reenactment undertaking, but we are approaching this from a game perspective and it has to be fun too.

This text is written in german, intended to sound old and obsolete, without actually being in an older dialect like middle high german or even old german. Please do not use this to learn german. It is wrong on purpose. Even the spelling is artificially varied, as 'correct' spelling is a construct of the 19th century.
